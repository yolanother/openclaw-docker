# OpenClaw Docker Local Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and customize as needed
#
# Note: Shell variables like $HOME will be expanded when the script sources this file

# OpenClaw configuration directory
# Default: ~/.openclaw
OPENCLAW_VOLUME="$HOME/.openclaw"

# OpenClaw workspace directory (deprecated - workspace is now part of OPENCLAW_VOLUME)
# The workspace directory is automatically accessible at ~/.openclaw/workspace
# This variable is kept for backwards compatibility but is no longer mounted separately
# OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_VOLUME="$HOME/.openclaw/workspace"

# OpenClaw host binding (for network access)
# Default: 0.0.0.0 (accessible from network)
# Set to 127.0.0.1 for localhost-only access
# OPENCLAW_HOST="0.0.0.0"

# Examples:
# Use a custom location (with variable expansion):
# OPENCLAW_VOLUME="$HOME/my-openclaw/config"

# Or use absolute paths (without variable expansion):
# OPENCLAW_VOLUME="/opt/openclaw/config"

# For testing on different paths:
# OPENCLAW_VOLUME="$HOME/openclaw-test"
